> An extensible image viewer built with web tech.

SIV is an extensible image viewer built using
[Electron](http://electron.atom.io),
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and
[Redux](http://redux.js.org/). SIV also relies heavily on the
[HTML5 Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). SIV's
original purpose was to solve issues in the pipeline integrity
industry. But, plans are in the works to create less specialised
extensions and to expose a developer API in the near future.
